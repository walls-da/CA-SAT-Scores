# CA-SAT-Scores
Data analysis on California state SAT scores concerning factors the affect test participation

## Project Overview
This projet investigated SAT data at the school and county level via Jupyter Notebook. Various analyses were conducted such as a geospatial analysis, supervised machine learning for regression, and unsupervised machine learning with clustering. Insights gleamed possible indicators for test participation and highlighted areas that require deeper analysis.

## Questions
•	Does grade size affect scores?

•	Which SAT category has higher/lower scores?

•	Which district has higher/lower scores? 

• Do the SAT categories vary for each district?
      
•	How does this data compare to other years?

•	How does this data compare to other states?
